Stop I'm not here for your games
Telling me you care about me over and over again
Could give ah... about feelings
Unless its about Y O U now
And I know the game that you're playing
Think I can't see the words, all the stupid sh... that you're saying
Could give ah... about your feelings
But you'd rather give me an excuse
Now now
And I know you think I'm crazy
At least that's what you told my friends
Does it hurt that I'm not?
Crazy about ya
Think we're cute together but I'm cute without ya
And I don't think about ya
You're her problem now and I'm cute without ya
Ah ah
Na na na na
Ah ah
Stop you can save your breath
Telling me you care about me I don't wanna hear it
Could give ah... about your feelings
But you're just like everybody else
Now now
And I don't care about the trauma
Let them talk, let them talk, let them talk
Say you're not obsessed with love
He doth protest too much
Now now
And I know you think I'm crazy
So why do you keep dropping my name?
Does it hurt that I'm not?
Crazy about ya
Think we're cute together but I'm cute without ya
And I don't think about ya
You're her problem now and I'm cute without ya
Crazy about ya
Think we're cute together but I'm cute without ya
And I don't think about ya
You're her problem now and I'm cute without ya
Ah ah
Na na na na
Ah ah
And I know you think I'm crazy
So does your new girlfriend
Does it hurt that I'm not?
Crazy about ya
Think we're cute together but I'm cute without ya
And I don't think about ya
You're her problem now and I'm cute without ya
Crazy about ya
Think we're cute together but I'm cute without ya
And I don't think about ya
You're her problem now and I'm cute without ya
Ah ah
Na na na na
Ah ah

Stop I'm not here for your games
Telling me you care about me over and over again
Could give ah... about feelings
Unless its about Y O U now
And I know the game that you're playing
Think I can't see the words, all the stupid sh... that you're saying
Could give ah... about your feelings
But you'd rather give me an excuse
Now now
And I know you think I'm crazy
At least that's what you told my friends
Does it hurt that I'm not?
Crazy about ya
Think we're cute together but I'm cute without ya
And I don't think about ya
You're her problem now and I'm cute without ya
Ah ah
Na na na na
Ah ah
Stop you can save your breath
Telling me you care about me I don't wanna hear it
